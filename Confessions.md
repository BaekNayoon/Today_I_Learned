- I was confused because many cars were parked outside today... apparently it is prom and the house across the street invited many people over so they could ... go to prom? The weather is rainy and cold. I'm a little happy to think that everyone's prom clothes got wet. 
- My friends and I got a dress up game because... why not? (Yes, I am in high school, and I play this dress up game, because this game is actually fun, and you can attack people) My friend Allan has received the most friend requests out of all of us (which first made me a little jealous since I have not received any except automated FaceBook Friends), but I am happy because looking at the usernames and outfits, those people are most likely old men weebs. 
- About two or three months ago, my friend Daniel tried to copy my drawing, and he was really bad. I joked about it, and said "you should stop drawing". Today, he showed us a recent drawing, and it was INCREDIBLE! I was really proud that he improved so much in such a short amount of time... I feel kind of bad for telling him to stop.
