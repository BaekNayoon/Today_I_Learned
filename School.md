- History class: King Henry the 8th had six wives (he banishes the first, divorces the second, beheads the third, the fourth died in childbirth, executes the fifth, and the sixth wife outlived him, making their 10 year-old son the next King... this is not an appreciation post, although it could be)

- Tech Theater: old man makeup and facial hair
- Math class: Surprise test! Great...
